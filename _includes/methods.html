        <h3 class="body-copy call-out">It’s time to move beyond just gut feelings.</h3>
        <p class="body-copy">To operate on a high level while maintaining an intimate relationship with our clients requires us to have one shared characteristic: a deep and vigorous love for research. Our team gets just as excited about the latest webinar as we do the new Star Wars. We use chi-square analysis to determine the correlation between coffee consumption and productivity. After every date, we follow up with a likert-scale survey to gauge our performance. We use Net Promoter Scores to determine who’s allowed to join us for lunch that day. And most importantly, we only work with people who pity laugh at our dirty “mahalanobis” jokes (Just Google it).</p>
        <p class="body-copy">But seriously. We are dedicated to our research and we use our passion to come up with the results that make real differences for our clients. With a firm foundation in the field and a team with such a diverse skill set, we are prepared to go the distance and do what needs to be done to find answers. NoDay is in the business of helping your business flourish.</p>
        <p class="body-copy strong">No more hunches.</p>
