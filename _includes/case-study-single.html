        <p class="body-copy">Andy’s Frozen Custard has proven time after time (in our best Cyndi Lauper voice) that they exceed the expectations of any dessert company. Hailing from the Midwest, but rapidly expanding outward and into new territories, Andy’s has always been on the innovative, cutting edge of delicious frozen custard treats. As a company that is experiencing rapid growth, crucial decisions and problems will inevitably present themselves along the way. Andy’s hired NoDay because they needed to know that when making these paramount decisions, they should operate off of facts, not hunches.</p>

        <p class="body-copy">We surveyed over 7,000 Andy’s customers to find out a few key aspects of their company. Who are the customers? How price sensitive are they? How is our advertising affecting customers and sales? How is the user experience when using our application and loyalty program? When building new stores does outdoor seating have any impact on sales?</p>
