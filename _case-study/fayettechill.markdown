Short Description: When it comes to fashion, brand is everything. But how is yours
  stacking up? We set out to find exactly how Fayettechill’s customers think and feel
  about their brand.
Content:
- Title: Understanding how the customer understands you.
  Paragraph: Fayettechill is a clothing company that not only appeals to its specific
    niche customer, but also has a broad consumer base that is sold on its products;
    anywhere from the die hard fashion-heads to the recreational trend-follower. They
    have been rising in the ranks of popularity over these past few years, faster
    than it takes the normal person to spell “Fayettechill”. Serving such a unique
    and wide customer base, sometimes the perception of a brand’s image is just as
    different as the people that wear it. NoDay teamed up with Fayettechill to discover
    exactly what runs through the customer’s mind when they think about the Fayettechill
    brand and then revealed what factors of the company affect these perceptions.
- Title: The Approach.
  Paragraph: 'First, we constructed an unprompted qualitative survey to 1,000 customers
    to explore the wide variety of activities and characteristics that customers associate
    with Fayettechill. In a follow up survey to 6,000 more customers, we tested pre-determined
    company qualities that Fayettechill desired to be associated with, against what
    the customer showed they were thinking in the first survey. Our second survey
    was designed for Likert-Scale ratings to gauge how strong of an association customers
    have with certain activities and characteristics. We answered questions such as:
    Do customers think of us like we want them to? Like we think of ourselves? How
    can we build these brand associations? '
- Title: The Outcome.
  Paragraph: Our extended work with Fayettechill is still en route! Their unique needs
    have been best met by a multi-stage research project leading to a final aggregate
    survey. This final survey pulls data from previous research to create a reliable
    and unbiased brand image. We know you are on the edge of your seats, but you are
    gonna have to wait a bit for these juicy results.
