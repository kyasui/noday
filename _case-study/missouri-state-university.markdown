- Title: Discovering the secrets to your customers happiness.
  Paragraph: 'A gem of the midwest, Missouri State University stands as not only the
    second largest university in Missouri, but as one of the most valuable public
    universities in the region. With over 25,000 students, you could say they have
    a lot on their plate. In 2015 Missouri State University (MSU) overhauled their
    food and drink vendors, and we helped them find out just what students were really
    hungry for. '
- Title: The Approach.
  Paragraph: Before jumping into a full survey, we went directly to the customer.
    By conducting in-depth one-on-one interviews with students as they tried different
    potential products we were able to gain some valuable insights. We noted subtle
    factors like expressions, audible reactions, selection tendencies, and overall
    impressions. After deep discussion and formulating our first few opinions, we
    tested them in larger focus groups to better reaffirm our hypothesis. After our
    qualitative analysis was understood, we took it to the rest of the student body
    via a quantitative survey to find out exactly what the students wanted on their
    plates.
- Title: The Outcome.
  Paragraph: Simply put, the customers spoke. In our post-analysis the answers were
    very clear. After presenting the university with the facts, they made the decisions
    necessary to keep their students happy and offer the products and vendors that
    were requested. By working with NoDay, Missouri State University was able to make
    decisions based on facts.
