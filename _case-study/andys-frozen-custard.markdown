Short Description: There are some aspects of business you simply can't cut corners
  on. Arguably the most important of these is measuring, retaining, and enhancing
  customer and employee relationships and engagement. We help our clients capture
  the feelings of their customers and employees, then turn those findings into tangible,
  actionable, and genuine improvements.

- Title: LISTENING TO CUSTOMERS TO MAKE WAY FOR THE FUTURE.
  Paragraph: Andy’s Frozen Custard has proven time after time (in our best Cyndi Lauper
    voice) that they exceed the expectations of any dessert company. Hailing from
    the Midwest, but rapidly expanding outward and into new territories, Andy’s has
    always been on the innovative, cutting edge of delicious frozen custard treats.
    As a company that is experiencing rapid growth, crucial decisions and problems
    will inevitably present themselves along the way. Andy’s hired NoDay because they
    needed to know that when making these paramount decisions, they should operate
    off of facts, not hunches.
- Title: THE APPROACH.
  Paragraph: We surveyed over 7,000 Andy’s customers to find out a few key aspects
    of their company. Who are the customers? How price sensitive are they? How is
    our advertising affecting customers and sales? How is the user experience when
    using our application and loyalty program? When building new stores does outdoor
    seating have any impact on sales?
- Title: THE OUTCOME.
  Paragraph: Our research exposed some very important insights and a more in-depth
    understanding of the customer. Our results have successfully guided Andy’s Frozen
    Custard to final decisions that have made big effects on the future. They have
    used our data for walking franchisees and employees through a more clear understanding
    of their customers mind and what they can do to better serve them.
