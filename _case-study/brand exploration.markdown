Short Description: "\"The makeup is simply an extension of the personality and colors,
  clothing, makeup all express something.\" -Future prospective Nobel Peace Prize
  winner (in our opinion), Gene Simmons. \n\nBut what is the \"makeup\" of your business,
  and how is it expressed? We can help pinpoint key aspects of your brand's image
  and identity to improve strategy and marketing efforts."
Content:
- Title: Understanding how the customer understands you.
  Paragraph: 'Have you ever found yourself wondering what people think about your
    business? Customer or not, everyone has opinions and feelings when they interact
    with your brand. When companies can better understand those beliefs and perspectives,
    they can redirect brand strategy, which will allow for better marketing and thus,
    leads to increased brand loyalty and boosted sales. '
- Title: The Approach.
  Paragraph: At NODAY, we are the authority on brands. Some would say we are obsessed.
    We don't just find out what customers are thinking and feeling, we use psychology
    metrics and statistical tests to create real, applicable strategies. We first
    define the companies brand identity; how the company thinks their customers see
    them. Then, we determine the brand image; how customers actually perceive the
    brand. Once we establish these two principles and their differences, we begin
    to dig deeper. Who is saying what? Why are they saying it? Is it affecting sales
    and usage? These will help us establish changes that should be made to the brand
    strategy for the future.
- Title: The Outcome.
  Paragraph: 'Our brand studies have helped companies with their "makeup" by aligning
    their goals, aesthetic, and ideals with the customer''s perceptions. Marketing
    will become more efficient and effective, which will lead to higher sales and
    a brand loyalty that can''t be pierced by the sharpest sword. '
